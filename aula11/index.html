        SIX SEVEN
    </header>

    <div class="conteudo">
        <p>6-7 (pronounced "six seven") is an internet meme and slang term that emerged in early 2025 on TikTok and Instagram Reels.
</p>
        <p class="caixa-sticky"></p>
        <p>[1] It originated from the repeated lyric "6-7" in the song "Doot Doot (6 7)" by Skrilla, which was used on social media in video edits of professional basketball players such as LaMelo Ball who is 6 ft 7 in (2.01 meters) tall,[2][3] and popularized further by Overtime Elite player Taylen "TK" Kinney because of viral clips showing his repeated use of "6-7".[4] The term "6-7" spread as slang among Generation Z and Generation Alpha.[5][6] As the meme's reach expanded in March 2025, one boy became known as the "67 Kid" after a viral video showed him saying the term while moving his hands up and down at an Amateur Athletic Union basketball game.[7][8] It is often compared to 41, a meme of similar origin, where rapper Blizzi Boi in his song "41 Song (Saks Freestyle)" repeats the number "41" throughout.[9] According to multiple sources, the '6-7' meme is also considered brain rot.[10][11][12]</p>

        <p>Origin and spread
"6-7" is a repeated lyric in the song "Doot Doot (6 7)" by hip hop artist Skrilla, a possible reference to 67th Street in Chicago.[13] The song came out in December 2024 (before its official release on February 7, 2025) and was used in video edits of professional basketball players, but specifically LaMelo Ball due to him being 6 ft. 7 in. tall. As a slang, the numbers carry no fixed meaning at all; the randomness itself and fun-to-say quality is what makes the phrase humorous.[14] Around the same time, Taylen "TK" Kinney, a high school basketball prospect at Overtime Elite, also became strongly associated with the phrase after a clip of him ranking a Starbucks drink by saying "six, seven" went viral on social media.[4][15] His repeated use of the phrase during Overtime Elite content led to his nickname "Mr. 6-7," and he later launched a "6-7" branded canned water line.[4][15] The meme's reach has spread to NBA highlights, WNBA news conferences, NFL touchdown celebrations, and also spread to celebrities, including former NBA player Shaquille O'Neal, who participated in a video referencing it despite admitting he did not understand its meaning.[4] It has since spread beyond music and sports, and into a broader Internet phenomenon.[16][6]</p>
